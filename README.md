# Project 3

The source code is located in subdirectories of the `src` directory;
use the `Makefile` to build it.  The executable will be added to the
`bin` directory.

You will need to complete the following files in the src/type-checker
directory: chk-exp.sml, chk-pat.sml, and type-checker.sml.

**NOTE:** you must have the location of SML/NJ in your shell `PATH`
variable for the build chain to work.
